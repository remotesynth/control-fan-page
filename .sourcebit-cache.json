The Board appears in the form of a large, inverted black pyramid hovering within the Astral Plane, and communicates primarily through seemingly telepathic messages in a complex language that can be understood partially by [parautilitarians](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Parautilitarian \"Parautilitarian\"). As represented in subtitles, many of the terms used by the Board have multiple, often contradictory meanings, creating a juxtaposition in their communication; it is unknown if this results from a difficulty the Board faces in translating its messages, or a disagreement within the Board itself. In one instance, the Board told [Jesse Faden](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Jesse_Faden \"Jesse Faden\") to simply ignore it due to the difficulty of communicating their message.\n\nThe origins and nature of the Board are unknown, but [Bureau](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/FBC \"FBC\") research suggests the Board possesses a strong, perhaps intrinsic connection to the [Oldest House](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Oldest_House \"Oldest House\"). The Board attributes its origins, as well as the House's, to the [Foundation](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Foundation \"Foundation\"), located in the [Black Rock Quarry](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Rock_Quarry \"Black Rock Quarry\"). The Board possesses immense paranatural powers and a connection to [Objects of Power](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Objects_of_Power \"Objects of Power\"), and ordain [rituals](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Ritual \"Ritual\") enabling certain parautilitarians to bind to these OoPs and utilize their powers; it is unknown if these connections are natural, or merely imposed by the Board itself. The Board is not the only entity to exist within the Astral Plane, as other entities - such as [Former](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Former \"Former\") - have been shown to impose their own connections to Altered Items and consensus reality. The [Service Weapon](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Service_Weapon \"Service Weapon\") appears to be one of the most significant OoPs to the Board; the individual chosen by the Board to wield it is implied to possess immense paranatural abilities, enabling them to control all other Objects of Power. As a result, the FBC, with the primary goal of controlling paranatural phenomena, ordains this individual as the Bureau's [Director](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Control \"Director of the Federal Bureau of Control\").\n\nThe Board possesses somewhat metafictional tendencies, and many of its telepathic messages make references to elements of *[Control](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Control \"Control\")* as a video game, including the player and the game's content rating."}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"pyifz91mcau0"}},"id":"3FMOrkQeloKQALM68TDSAX","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-02-20T19:38:01.734Z","updatedAt":"2020-02-21T13:55:51.103Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":6,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"blogPost"}}},"fields":{"title":{"en-US":"Federal Bureau of Control"},"date":{"en-US":"2020-02-06T00:00-05:00"},"description":{"en-US":"The Federal Bureau of Control (FBC) is a clandestine United States government organization tasked with the containment, study, and control of paranatural phenomena.
