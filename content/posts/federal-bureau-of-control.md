The **Federal Bureau of Control** (**FBC**) is a clandestine United States government organization tasked with the containment, study, and control of [paranatural](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Paranatural "Paranatural") phenomena. Operating on a national scale, the FBC investigates events and objects which violate the known laws of nature, with the goal of understanding and controlling these elements. The Bureau's headquarters is a mysterious Brutalist skyscraper in New York City known as the [Oldest House](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Oldest_House "Oldest House"), which exists outside of ordinary reality.

The FBC is responsible for both the scientific study of paranatural elements and the protection of the nation (and humanity as a whole) from these forces. Among the phenomena studied by the FBC are [Altered World Events](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/AWE "AWE") (AWEs), [Altered Items](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Altered_Items "Altered Items"), [Objects of Power](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Object_of_Power "Object of Power"), and other realms and dimensions beyond our own. The Oldest House, itself a paranormal location, serves as a containment and study facility for these types of phenomena.

The leadership of the FBC is determined by the [Board](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/The_Board "The Board"), an [extradimensional being](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Extradimensional_being "Extradimensional being"), through the [Service Weapon](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Service_Weapon "Service Weapon") Object of Power. The current [Director of the Federal Bureau of Control](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Control "Director of the Federal Bureau of Control") is [Jesse Faden](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Jesse_Faden "Jesse Faden"), having succeeded the late [Zachariah Trench](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Zachariah_Trench "Zachariah Trench") after his death during the [Hiss invasion](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Hiss_invasion "Hiss invasion").
