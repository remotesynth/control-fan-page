The **Board** (also known as the **Black Pyramid**) is an [extradimensional being](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Extradimensional_being "Extradimensional being") or group of beings existing within the [Astral Plane](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Astral_Plane "Astral Plane"). Appearing in the form of an enormous inverted black pyramid, the Board appears to be responsible for selecting the [Director](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Control "Director of the Federal Bureau of Control") of the [Federal Bureau of Control](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Control "Federal Bureau of Control"), while also possessing various connections to [Objects of Power](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Objects_of_Power "Objects of Power") within ordinary reality. The true nature and motivations of the Board are unknown.

The Board is a mysterious and powerful entity or group of entities that exists within the [Astral Plane](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Astral_Plane "Astral Plane"), a vast alternate dimension connected to the human collective unconscious. The Board appears in the form of a large, inverted black pyramid hovering within the Astral Plane, and communicates primarily through seemingly telepathic messages in a complex language that can be understood partially by [parautilitarians](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Parautilitarian "Parautilitarian"). As represented in subtitles, many of the terms used by the Board have multiple, often contradictory meanings, creating a juxtaposition in their communication; it is unknown if this results from a difficulty the Board faces in translating its messages, or a disagreement within the Board itself. In one instance, the Board told [Jesse Faden](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Jesse_Faden "Jesse Faden") to simply ignore it due to the difficulty of communicating their message.

The origins and nature of the Board are unknown, but [Bureau](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/FBC "FBC") research suggests the Board possesses a strong, perhaps intrinsic connection to the [Oldest House](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Oldest_House "Oldest House"). The Board attributes its origins, as well as the House's, to the [Foundation](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Foundation "Foundation"), located in the [Black Rock Quarry](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Rock_Quarry "Black Rock Quarry"). The Board possesses immense paranatural powers and a connection to [Objects of Power](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Objects_of_Power "Objects of Power"), and ordain [rituals](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Ritual "Ritual") enabling certain parautilitarians to bind to these OoPs and utilize their powers; it is unknown if these connections are natural, or merely imposed by the Board itself. The Board is not the only entity to exist within the Astral Plane, as other entities - such as [Former](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Former "Former") - have been shown to impose their own connections to Altered Items and consensus reality. The [Service Weapon](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Service_Weapon "Service Weapon") appears to be one of the most significant OoPs to the Board; the individual chosen by the Board to wield it is implied to possess immense paranatural abilities, enabling them to control all other Objects of Power. As a result, the FBC, with the primary goal of controlling paranatural phenomena, ordains this individual as the Bureau's [Director](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Control "Director of the Federal Bureau of Control").

The Board possesses somewhat metafictional tendencies, and many of its telepathic messages make references to elements of *[Control](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Control "Control")* as a video game, including the player and the game's content rating.
