The **Hiss** is a hostile [paranatural](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Paranatural "Paranatural") force of [resonance](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Resonance "Resonance") that invaded the [Oldest House](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Oldest_House "Oldest House") on [October 29, 2019](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Hiss_invasion "Hiss invasion"), resulting in the near-destruction of the [Federal Bureau of Control](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Control "Federal Bureau of Control"). Originating from an alternate dimension, the Hiss influenced FBC Director [Zachariah Trench](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Zachariah_Trench "Zachariah Trench") into unleashing it using the [Slide Projector](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Slide_Projector "Slide Projector") [Object of Power](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Object_of_Power "Object of Power"). The Hiss's source of resonance was cut off by [Jesse Faden](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Jesse_Faden "Jesse Faden") when she deactivated the Projector; however, the possessed Hiss agents still lingered in the Oldest House, continuing to pose a major threat.

The Hiss originated from an alternate dimension which could be reached via one of the slides connected to the [Slide Projector](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Slide_Projector "Slide Projector") [Object of Power](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Object_of_Power "Object of Power") from [Ordinary, Wisconsin](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Ordinary "Ordinary"). During the [Ordinary AWE](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Ordinary_AWE "Ordinary AWE"), [Jesse Faden](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Jesse_Faden "Jesse Faden") burned all but one of the slides ([Slidescape-36](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Slidescape-36 "Slidescape-36")), and the Projector was contained by the [FBC](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/FBC "FBC"). [Zachariah Trench](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Zachariah_Trench "Zachariah Trench") kept one of the burned slides. As exploration of Slidescape-36 was carried out under the supervision of [Casper Darling](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Casper_Darling "Casper Darling"), Trench, attending one of the expeditions, fell under the influence of the Hiss. When Darling returned the [Hedron](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Hedron "Hedron") from Slidescape-36 and began to produce [HRAs](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/HRA "HRA"), Trench, fearing Hedron would take over the entire Bureau, unleashed the Hiss upon the [Oldest House](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Oldest_House "Oldest House") on [October 29, 2019](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Hiss_invasion "Hiss invasion"). The Hiss nearly destroyed the entire Bureau, possessing its agents, the topography of the Oldest House, and numerous [Altered Items](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Altered_Items "Altered Items") and Objects of Power. An external lockdown was placed in effect, cutting off the building's sectors from one another.
